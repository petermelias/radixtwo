		<h4 class="">Hi there. My name is Peter.</h4>
		<p>I enjoy <a href="http://github.com/petermelias" target="_blank">writing computer programs</a>, solving math and logic problems, and shooting things with a multitude of projectile devices.</p>

		<p>When I am not writing code, you are likely to find me at <a href="http://www.redsguns.com/" target="_blank">the shooting range</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/state-parks/enchanted-rock" target="_blank">doing something rural</a>, <a href="http://www.bostonkravmaga.com/kravmagaboston-instructor.html" target="_blank">training martial arts</a>, <a href="http://www.pterrys.com/locations.html" target="_blank">eating at Pterry's</a>, or doing house chores.</p>

		<p>I am not entirely a computer geek, nor entirely a jock / meathead / bro. I am also not entirely mature. In fact, some would say I am a child and always will be. I hope those people are right.</p>

		<p>At one point I ran a small summer camp that tought children how to program, amongst other computer skills such as Photoshop, Digital Film and such. Before I ran the camp, I was a camper there. That experience is arguably what jump started my voracious appetite for computing related knowledge.</p>

		<p>I never went to college for programming, in fact I have a BS from <a href="http://babson.edu" target="_blank">Babson College</a>. I am so glad that I did not do a Computer Science program, that I have several articles that I will be publishing explaining precisely why it was better that I learned through starting a business and from application-based scenarios</p>

		<p>Even beyond that, is my fascination with the modern education system, both in the United States and abroad. I plan to dedicate a large portion of my time and money to addressing some rather pointed concerns that I will also publish articles about.</p>

		<p>I hijacked and hid a campus police car one time as a prank and never got caught.</p>

		<p>I fired a 7' foot potato canon loaded with 2 potatoes into a harbor off the coast of MA at 3 AM and accidentally dropped in the roof of a boat house. The coast guard responded and we all hid in the basement while they conducted a search of the harbor and surrounding homes</p>

		<p>I have been stopped speeding 14 times in the state of Massachusetts. I had to take a driver retraining course (in Western Mass) because of it and met some of the most interesting people I have ever encountered. I would do it again just for the company.</p>
		<p>The City of Boston has cited me 47 parking tickets. Most of them I received while faithfully visiting my girlfriend in Chinatown (she's not asian). I eventually paid them all after they mailed me a seizure notice for my vehicle.</p>
		<p>When I was renting a working space in the sketchiest part of Boston (cheap sq. footage) for my web company, I came home one night just in time to witness a murder. When the Boston police arrived, they laughed and told me it happens every day and that I should move.</p>
		<p>When I was in Israel training krav maga / Hisardut with the Israeli army and the Mossad, I had the pleasure of watching some of the most elite martial artists in the world happily demonstrate how to kill with modern AND medieval weapons. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVfJV2dEz6E">Here's the guy I trained with</a></p>
		<p>I do not use the various social media outlets today because I spend so much time sitting and programming, that when I am finished, the last thing I want to do is sit more and read an endless stream of largely useless information.</p>
		<p>Previous sentence notwithstanding, I think YouTube is awesome, Stack Overflow is a godsend, Twitter is ocassionally useful, and LinkedIN is good for business.</p>

		<p>I have an amazing family who I respect deeply for their entreprenurial lingeage, their support, my upbringing and tolerance for my bullshit</p>

		<p>My brother is the best brother I have ever had. In fact, he's the only one, but he's still the best.</p>

		<p>I don't have very many friends because I am a fairly honest person and most people nowadays don't like that. The friends I do have though, I would die for.</p>
		<p>I met my girlfriend while practicing my knife throwing at 2 AM in the middle of nowhere in New Hampshire. She's from Miami.</p>
