		This site is the fiery product of years of pent up intention and procrastination. I have been meaning to make an online place for my silliness for quite some time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Believe it or not, I designed, coded and launched this entire site in 6 hours completely from scratch.
	</p>
	<p>
		Disclaimer: I have been doing professional web development for 11 years.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I was not capable of the aforementioned feat, then I wouldn't really be living up to my profession.
	</p>
	<p>
		Still-- I am claiming bragging rights because I am not a designer, or a front-end dev. I am a back-end troll that has spent more time speaking computer languages than human ones.
	</p>
	<p>
		I can't draw a straight line for shit.
	</p>
	<p>
		I just had a sudden burst of artistic inspiration (read: desert storm theme) and somehow it just worked.
		Anyway, enjoy the site.
	</p>

		<p>
			<li>Q: Why is your navigation so abstract?</li>

		</p>

		<p>
			<li>Q: So you're a programmer huh... Can I hire you? I've got this idea, it's like Facebook but with a twist.</li>
			<li>A: Nope.</a></li>
		</p>

		<p>
			<li>Q: Are you a wizard?</li>
			<li>A: I was once. I'm impressed you could tell actually. I relinquished my powers so that <a target="_blank" href="http://falconstephanie.com">I could be with a mortal woman who I love very much</a> and  for whom I would gladly sacrifice again if given the choice.</a></li>
